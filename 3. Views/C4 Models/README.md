# C4 Models
We are using [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) to build our models.   

> The C4 model is a way to help software development teams describe and communicate software architecture.
> In order to create these maps of your code, we first need a common set of abstractions to create a ubiquitous language 
> that we can use to describe the static structure of a software system. The C4 model considers the static structures of 
> a software system in terms of containers, components and code. And people use the software systems that we build.

## Level 1. System Context
> Level 1: A System Context diagram provides a starting point, showing how the software system in scope fits into the world around it.

## Level 2. Container
> Level 2: A Container diagram zooms into the software system in scope, showing the high-level technical building blocks.

## Level 3. Component
> Level 3: A Component diagram zooms into an individual container, showing the components inside it.
