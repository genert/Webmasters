# Business Case

The Hey Blue is a platform for creating meaningful connections between police officers and members of community by offering opportunities for individuals to meet and share positive experiences. 

These positive interactions turn into points that the private citizen can use to purchase items and the police officer can donate to a non-profit or family in need.

## Business Drivers

What business drivers can we learn from the situation:

- Lack of awareness/opportunities between police officers and local communities.
- Lack of a way to turn opportunities between police officers and local communities into positive experiences (donations, purchasing items).

## Business Goals

The company establishes the following business goals to help the situation:

1. Connect civilians and police officers for positive connections.
2. Turn connections into points and exchange those points for goods/donations or pay down municipal penalties (civilians).
