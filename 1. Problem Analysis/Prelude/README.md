# Prelude

The Hey Blue is inititative of creating meaningful connections between police officers and members of community by offering opportunities for individuals to meet and share positive experiences.

## Vision

Inspired by the extraordinary acts of heroism displayed by both individual community members and first responders during 9/11, EcoSchool co-founder, John Verdi, wanted to build a platform that could bring police officers and communities together with a shared purpose.
